On top of that, by adding Elliot to your browser you’ll also be able to use Bing’s search engine and still donate water!",

          'Because water means health, education, women’s empowerment, and childhood.\nSimply put, Water means Life! More than 565 million people in the world either lack access to water or pay for it 10 to 15 times more than the middle class. This translates to either having to spend a large amount of money to get water or to having to fetch for it every day.\nFetching water means that kids and women will have to spend up to 6 hours a day collecting water from unreliable sources which then means poor water quality, no time for kids to go to school and be kids, and no time for women to work and earn an income.\nBy proving people with reliable and safe access to clean water, though, we can change all this and make sure that every person in the world has a chance to create their own future!\nOur first goal is to provide 1 million people with access to safe water.',
